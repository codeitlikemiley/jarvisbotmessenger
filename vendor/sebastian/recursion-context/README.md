# Recursion Context

...

## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-bot dependency to your bot using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require sebastian/recursion-context

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your bot's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

    composer require --dev sebastian/recursion-context
